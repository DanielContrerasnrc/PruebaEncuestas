# Satisfaction survey

in this application, the most important classes that have an impact on the application are the following:
-src/java/com/twilio/controller/Controller this is the main class since it has the connection to the database and the one that defragments the json and with this it is sent to SessionData.
-src/java/com/twilio/controller/SessionnData this is in charge of receiving the data and doing the insertion and returning the result to controller.
